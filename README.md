## Gophy
Gophy is p2p software written from scratch to implement and test ideas for a novel blockchain network that is based on the idea of useful work. Its goal is to provide anyone the ability to donate computational power to a real-world High Energy Physics (HEP) experiment by running Monte Carlo simulation tasks sent out by a privileged node called the Root Authority (RA). The RA is a node that will be run by a representative of the experiment to ensure the 'usefulness' aspect of tasks.
